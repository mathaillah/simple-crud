# Simple CRUD Web Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a client-side web application that runs entirely in the browser with no server dependencies
- Implement complete CRUD functionality for managing name and email entries
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface with responsive design
- Enable data persistence using browser's localStorage API
- Deliver a functional application within 1 week of development time
- Achieve high usability with users able to complete tasks in under 30 seconds
- Maintain code quality with less than 3 critical bugs reported

### Background Context
The Simple CRUD Web Application addresses the need for a straightforward tool to manage basic contact information (name and email pairs) directly in the browser without requiring any server or hosting technology. Users currently rely on inefficient tools like spreadsheets or text files that lack interactive capabilities. This solution provides a lightweight alternative that focuses exclusively on essential CRUD functionality while eliminating all server dependencies, making it instantly accessible to anyone with a web browser.

This project builds on our previous brainstorming session which identified key user needs around simplicity, data privacy (local storage only), and ease of use. The application targets individuals and small teams who want a better experience than spreadsheets or text files but prefer to avoid the complexity and cost of server-based solutions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience will focus on extreme simplicity and immediate usability. Users should be able to understand and use all features without any instructions or guidance. The interface will have a clean, uncluttered design with clear visual hierarchy that directs attention to the core functionality: creating, reading, updating, and deleting contact entries.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Direct manipulation of data through inline editing
- Immediate feedback for all user actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete)
- Single-page application with no navigation between pages
- Keyboard accessibility for power users

### Core Screens and Views
- Main Application View: Contains entry form, entry list, and all controls
- Edit Mode Overlay: Modal or inline form for editing existing entries
- Delete Confirmation Dialog: Simple confirmation before removing entries

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, ensuring text contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### Branding
Minimal branding with a focus on functionality over aesthetics. A simple color scheme (blue for primary actions, red for destructive actions, neutral grays for backgrounds) will provide visual cues without distraction.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will work on all modern browsers across desktop and mobile devices with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
For this simple application, a monorepo structure will be used with all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in a single repository. This simplifies development and deployment since there are no complex dependencies or multiple services.

### Service Architecture
Pure client-side implementation with no backend services. All functionality will be contained within static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with data stored in the browser's localStorage API.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for JavaScript functions and manual testing of UI interactions. Given the simplicity of the application and lack of backend services, a full testing pyramid is not necessary. Focus will be on ensuring all CRUD operations work correctly and data persistence functions as expected.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use vanilla JavaScript without frameworks to minimize dependencies and file size
- Implement responsive design using CSS Flexbox or Grid
- Use localStorage API for data persistence with fallback to sessionStorage if needed
- Implement basic error handling for localStorage quota exceeded scenarios
- Follow modern ES6+ JavaScript practices for cleaner code
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent styling
- Optimize for performance with minimal DOM manipulation
