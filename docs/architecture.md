## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The Simple CRUD Web Application is a client-side only web application that runs entirely in the browser with no server dependencies. It uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to implement complete CRUD functionality for managing name and email entries. Data persistence is achieved through the browser's localStorage API, eliminating the need for any backend services. The architecture follows a single-page application (SPA) pattern with direct DOM manipulation, focusing on simplicity and immediate usability. The frontend is designed with responsive CSS using Flexbox/Grid for layout, ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile devices. This architecture achieves all PRD goals by providing a lightweight, privacy-focused contact management solution that requires no server infrastructure.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Client-side browser application
**Key Services:** None (runs entirely in browser)
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Any static file hosting or local file system

Rationale: The PRD specifically requires a client-side only application with no server dependencies. This approach ensures maximum simplicity, privacy (data never leaves the user's browser), and eliminates hosting costs. The application can run directly from a user's local file system or be hosted on any static file hosting service.

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with simple flat structure
**Monorepo Tool:** None (simple project structure)
**Package Organization:** 
- Single HTML file (index.html)
- CSS file (style.css)
- JavaScript file (main.js)

Rationale: The PRD specifies a simple application with no complex dependencies, making a flat file structure the most appropriate choice. This simplifies development and deployment while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

### Architectural Patterns

- **Client-Side SPA:** Single-page application running entirely in browser - _Rationale:_ Eliminates server dependencies and provides immediate responsiveness
- **Direct DOM Manipulation:** Vanilla JavaScript DOM operations - _Rationale:_ Avoids framework overhead for simple CRUD operations
- **Module Pattern:** JavaScript code organization using modules - _Rationale:_ Provides clean code organization without complex build tools
- **localStorage Persistence:** Browser-based data storage - _Rationale:_ Meets privacy requirements and eliminates server needs

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Browser] --> B[Main Application]
    B --> C[ContactService]
    B --> D[FormHandler]
    C --> E[localStorage]
    D --> F[Validation Functions]
```

## External APIs

This application does not require any external APIs as it runs entirely client-side with no server dependencies.

## Core Workflows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant ContactService
    participant localStorage

    User->>UI: Opens application
    UI->>ContactService: loadFromStorage()
    ContactService->>localStorage: getItem('contacts')
    localStorage-->>ContactService: Stored contacts
    ContactService-->>UI: Return contacts
    UI->>UI: Render contact list

    User->>UI: Fills name and email fields
    User->>UI: Clicks Submit button
    UI->>UI: Validate form data
    UI->>ContactService: createContact(name, email)
    ContactService->>ContactService: Generate ID and timestamps
    ContactService->>localStorage: setItem('contacts', updatedData)
    ContactService-->>UI: Return new contact
    UI->>UI: Add contact to list display
```

## Database Schema

Since this application uses localStorage for data persistence, the "schema" is represented as a JSON structure:

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "createdAt": "ISO timestamp",
      "updatedAt": "ISO timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```

The contacts array is serialized to JSON and stored in localStorage under the key "contacts". Each contact entry follows the structure defined in the data model with:

- id: Unique identifier (UUID v4 recommended)
- name: Contact's name (string)
- email: Contact's email address (string)
- createdAt: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the entry was created
- updatedAt: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the entry was last updated

Data validation is performed in the JavaScript code before saving to localStorage to ensure:
- Name is not empty
- Email matches a valid email format
- All required fields are present

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Architecture

#### Component Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ContactForm.js      # Form for creating/editing contacts
│   ├── ContactList.js      # Displays list of contacts
│   ├── ContactItem.js      # Individual contact display
│   └── Modal.js            # Modal dialog for editing
├── services/
│   └── ContactService.js   # Handles data operations
├── utils/
│   ├── validation.js       # Form validation functions
│   └── helpers.js          # Utility functions
├── styles/
│   └── main.css            # Global styles
└── main.js                 # Application entry point
```

#### Component Template

```javascript
// Basic component structure
class ComponentName {
  constructor(containerElement) {
    this.container = containerElement;
    this.state = {};
  }
  
  render() {
    // Render component UI
  }
  
  setState(newState) {
    this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };
    this.render();
  }
}
```

### State Management Architecture

#### State Structure

```javascript
// Application state structure
const appState = {
  contacts: [
    {
      id: 'uuid-string',
      name: 'string',
      email: 'string',
      createdAt: 'ISO-timestamp',
      updatedAt: 'ISO-timestamp'
    }
  ],
  currentView: 'list' | 'edit' | 'create',
  editingContactId: 'uuid-string' | null,
  errors: {
    name: 'string' | null,
    email: 'string' | null
  }
};
```

#### State Management Patterns

- Single source of truth for all application data
- State updates trigger UI re-renders
- Component-level state for UI-specific data
- Service-level state for persistent data

### Routing Architecture

#### Route Organization

This is a single-page application with no traditional routing. Views are managed through:
- Main contact list view
- Edit contact modal
- Create contact form (part of main view)

#### Protected Route Pattern

Not applicable for this client-side only application.

### Frontend Services Layer

#### API Client Setup

Not applicable as there is no external API. Direct localStorage access is used.

#### Service Example

```javascript
class ContactService {
  static getAll() {
    const data = localStorage.getItem('contacts');
    return data ? JSON.parse(data) : [];
  }
  
  static save(contacts) {
    localStorage.setItem('contacts', JSON.stringify(contacts));
  }
  
  static create(contactData) {
    const contacts = this.getAll();
    const newContact = {
      id: this.generateId(),
      ...contactData,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    contacts.push(newContact);
    this.save(contacts);
    return newContact;
  }
}
```

## Backend Architecture

This application does not have a backend as it runs entirely client-side with no server dependencies.
