## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the HTML structure created in Story 1.1.

### File Locations
- CSS file should be located at `css/style.css` (referenced in Story 1.1)
- The styling should work with the HTML structure already created:
  - Form elements for name and email input
  - Entry list display area
  - Controls for editing and deleting entries

### Previous Story Insights
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the foundation for styling
- Ensure CSS selectors match the HTML elements created in the previous story
- Consider using CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent styling as mentioned in the technical assumptions

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the CSS styling should be performed by:
- Checking responsive design on different screen sizes
- Verifying that form elements are properly styled
- Ensuring color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Testing hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on what needs to be styled and how.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - Are there specific breakpoints that should be used for the media queries?
  - What exact color values should be used for the color scheme?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the color scheme or typography requirements are more specific than described
  - If specific breakpoints are required that differ from standard responsive design practices

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines what needs to be styled and how, with specific acceptance criteria that can be tested.
