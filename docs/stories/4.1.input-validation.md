# Story 4.1: Input Validation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to validate my input,
**so that** I don't accidentally enter invalid data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement email format validation using regex
2. Ensure name field is not empty
3. Provide real-time validation feedback as users type
4. Prevent submission of invalid data
5. Display clear error messages for validation failures
6. Handle edge cases like extremely long inputs

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement email format validation using regex (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create regex pattern for email validation
  - [x] Implement validation function for email field
  - [x] Test regex pattern with various email formats
- [x] Ensure name field is not empty (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement validation function for name field
  - [x] Check for empty or whitespace-only input
  - [x] Handle trim of whitespace characters
- [x] Provide real-time validation feedback as users type (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add event listeners for input events
  - [x] Implement validation on field blur and input
  - [x] Display validation feedback immediately
- [x] Prevent submission of invalid data (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement form validation before submission
  - [x] Disable submit button when data is invalid
  - [x] Prevent form submission with invalid data
- [x] Display clear error messages for validation failures (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create user-friendly error messages
  - [x] Display error messages near relevant fields
  - [x] Ensure error messages are accessible
- [x] Handle edge cases like extremely long inputs (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement maximum length validation
  - [x] Handle very long input strings gracefully
  - [x] Provide feedback for inputs that are too long

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the create functionality (Story 3.1) and update functionality (Story 3.3).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- Validation functions should integrate with existing form handling code
- Error message display should work with existing UI elements

### Previous Story Insights
- The create functionality from Story 3.1 provides the foundation for form handling that needs validation
- The update functionality from Story 3.3 provides the edit form handling that needs validation
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the structure for valid data
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the form elements to validate
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation for error display

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing validation functions
- Implement proper regex pattern for email validation
- Consider performance implications of real-time validation
- Ensure validation feedback is accessible to all users
- Follow the validation requirements specified in the technical assumptions

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the input validation should be performed by:
- Verifying that email format validation works correctly with various inputs
- Checking that name field validation prevents empty submissions
- Testing real-time validation feedback as users type
- Ensuring submission is prevented with invalid data
- Verifying that clear error messages are displayed for validation failures
- Testing edge cases with extremely long inputs

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing input validation.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific regex pattern should be used for email validation?
  - How should real-time validation feedback be displayed visually?
  - What are the specific maximum length limits for name and email fields?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the regex pattern requirements are more complex than described
  - If the real-time validation performance needs optimization
  - If the error message display needs to be modified for better UX

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the input validation requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
