# Story 2.1: localStorage Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my contact entries to persist between browser sessions,
**so that** I don't lose my data when I close the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement functions to save data to localStorage
2. Implement functions to load data from localStorage
3. Handle cases where localStorage is not available or accessible
4. Implement error handling for quota exceeded scenarios
5. Ensure data is properly serialized and deserialized

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement functions to save data to localStorage (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create function to serialize contact entries
  - [x] Create function to save serialized data to localStorage
  - [x] Ensure data is saved with appropriate key
- [x] Implement functions to load data from localStorage (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create function to retrieve data from localStorage
  - [x] Create function to deserialize stored data
  - [x] Handle cases where no data exists
- [x] Handle cases where localStorage is not available or accessible (AC: 3)
  - [x] Check for localStorage availability
  - [x] Implement fallback mechanism (e.g., sessionStorage)
  - [x] Provide appropriate error handling
- [x] Implement error handling for quota exceeded scenarios (AC: 4)
  - [x] Catch quota exceeded errors
  - [x] Provide user-friendly error messages
  - [x] Implement fallback or cleanup mechanism
- [x] Ensure data is properly serialized and deserialized (AC: 5)
  - [x] Use JSON.stringify for serialization
  - [x] Use JSON.parse for deserialization
  - [x] Handle parsing errors gracefully

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the foundation established in Epic 1, particularly the JavaScript framework setup (Story 1.3).

### File Locations
- JavaScript functions should be added to `js/main.js` or in a separate module file
- The data persistence functionality should integrate with the existing data structure from Story 1.3

### Previous Story Insights
- The JavaScript framework from Story 1.3 provides the structure for implementing localStorage integration
- The data structure for storing entries in memory from Story 1.3 will need to be extended to work with localStorage
- Consider using the module pattern or classes for organizing the localStorage functionality

### Technical Considerations
- Use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse for serialization/deserialization as mentioned in the technical assumptions
- Implement proper error handling for localStorage operations as specified in the technical assumptions
- Consider using sessionStorage as a fallback as mentioned in the technical assumptions

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the localStorage integration should be performed by:
- Verifying that data is saved to localStorage correctly
- Checking that data is loaded from localStorage correctly
- Testing scenarios where localStorage is not available
- Testing quota exceeded scenarios
- Ensuring data is properly serialized and deserialized

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing localStorage integration.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific key should be used for storing data in localStorage?
  - Should we implement a specific fallback mechanism beyond sessionStorage?
  - How should we handle quota exceeded errors from a user experience perspective?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the data structure from Story 1.3 needs to be modified to work with localStorage
  - If specific error handling requirements are more complex than described

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the localStorage integration requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
