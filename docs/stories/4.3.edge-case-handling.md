# Story 4.3: Edge Case Handling

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to handle unusual situations gracefully,
**so that** my experience is consistent and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Handle cases where localStorage quota is exceeded
2. Manage scenarios where browser data is cleared
3. Deal with corrupted or invalid stored data
4. Handle rapid successive operations
5. Ensure proper behavior when browser tab is duplicated
6. Manage focus and keyboard navigation properly

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Handle cases where localStorage quota is exceeded (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Detect quota exceeded errors
  - [ ] Implement appropriate user feedback
  - [ ] Provide options for data management (e.g., clear old data)
- [ ] Manage scenarios where browser data is cleared (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Detect missing or cleared localStorage data
  - [ ] Initialize application with default state
  - [ ] Provide appropriate user guidance
- [ ] Deal with corrupted or invalid stored data (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement data validation for stored data
  - [ ] Handle parsing errors gracefully
  - [ ] Provide recovery mechanisms for corrupted data
- [ ] Handle rapid successive operations (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement debouncing or throttling for rapid operations
  - [ ] Ensure UI updates properly with rapid changes
  - [ ] Prevent race conditions in data operations
- [ ] Ensure proper behavior when browser tab is duplicated (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test application behavior with multiple tabs
  - [ ] Ensure data consistency across tabs
  - [ ] Handle focus and state management appropriately
- [ ] Manage focus and keyboard navigation properly (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement proper focus management
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
  - [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon all previous functionality, particularly the error handling (Story 4.2) and data management (Epic 2).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- Edge case handling should be added to existing functions throughout the application
- Focus management should integrate with existing UI elements

### Previous Story Insights
- The error handling from Story 4.2 provides the foundation for handling edge cases
- The localStorage integration from Story 2.1 provides the primary source of edge cases to handle
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the data operations that might encounter edge cases
- The CRUD functionality from Stories 3.1-3.4 provides the user-facing operations that need edge case handling
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the container for UI elements
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation for UI elements

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing edge case handling functions
- Implement proper debouncing or throttling for rapid operations
- Consider performance implications of edge case handling
- Ensure edge case handling doesn't introduce new failure points
- Follow accessibility best practices for focus management

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the edge case handling should be performed by:
- Verifying that localStorage quota exceeded cases are properly handled
- Checking that browser data clearing scenarios are managed gracefully
- Testing that corrupted or invalid stored data is handled appropriately
- Ensuring rapid successive operations are handled correctly
- Verifying proper behavior when browser tabs are duplicated
- Testing focus and keyboard navigation management

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing edge case handling.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific debouncing or throttling delays should be used for rapid operations?
  - How should we handle localStorage quota exceeded errors from a user experience perspective?
  - What specific focus management patterns should be implemented?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the edge case handling requirements are more complex than described
  - If additional edge cases need to be identified and handled
  - If the focus management needs to be modified for better accessibility

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the edge case handling requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
