# Story 4.2: Error Handling

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive clear feedback when something goes wrong,
**so that** I understand what happened and can take corrective action.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement error handling for localStorage failures
2. Provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
3. Handle network errors gracefully (though minimal in this app)
4. Implement fallback mechanisms for critical failures
5. Log errors appropriately for debugging purposes
6. Ensure application remains usable even when non-critical errors occur

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement error handling for localStorage failures (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Wrap localStorage operations in try/catch blocks
  - [ ] Handle quota exceeded errors
  - [ ] Handle security errors (access denied)
- [ ] Provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create clear, actionable error messages
  - [ ] Display errors in a consistent manner
  - [ ] Ensure error messages are accessible
- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully (though minimal in this app) (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Identify potential network-dependent operations
  - [ ] Implement fallback behavior for network failures
  - [ ] Provide appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for critical failures (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Identify critical application functions
  - [ ] Implement alternative approaches for critical failures
  - [ ] Ensure graceful degradation of functionality
- [ ] Log errors appropriately for debugging purposes (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement error logging mechanism
  - [ ] Include relevant context information in logs
  - [ ] Ensure logs are useful for debugging
- [ ] Ensure application remains usable even when non-critical errors occur (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Distinguish between critical and non-critical errors
  - [ ] Prevent non-critical errors from breaking the application
  - [ ] Continue functioning normally after non-critical errors

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon all previous functionality, particularly the localStorage integration (Story 2.1).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- Error handling should be added to existing functions throughout the application
- Error display mechanisms should integrate with existing UI elements

### Previous Story Insights
- The localStorage integration from Story 2.1 provides the primary source of potential errors to handle
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the data operations that might fail
- The CRUD functionality from Stories 3.1-3.4 provides the user-facing operations that need error handling
- The input validation from Story 4.1 provides additional validation error scenarios
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the container for error messages
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation for error display

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing error handling functions
- Implement proper try/catch blocks for error-prone operations
- Consider performance implications of error logging
- Ensure error handling doesn't introduce new failure points
- Follow the error handling requirements specified in the technical assumptions

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the error handling should be performed by:
- Verifying that localStorage failures are properly handled
- Checking that user-friendly error messages are displayed for all failure scenarios
- Testing network error handling (if applicable)
- Ensuring fallback mechanisms work for critical failures
- Verifying that errors are logged appropriately for debugging
- Testing that the application remains usable after non-critical errors

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing error handling.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific error logging mechanism should be used?
  - How should error messages be displayed visually?
  - What are considered critical vs. non-critical errors in this application?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the error handling requirements are more complex than described
  - If additional error scenarios need to be identified and handled
  - If the error message display needs to be modified for better UX

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the error handling requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
