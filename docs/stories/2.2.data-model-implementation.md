# Story 2.2: Data Model Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a consistent data model for contact entries,
**so that** data handling is predictable and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define a consistent structure for contact entry objects
2. Implement unique ID generation for each entry
3. Create functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in memory
4. Ensure data integrity with validation functions
5. Implement data migration strategy for future changes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define a consistent structure for contact entry objects (AC: 1)
  - [x] Define properties for contact entries (id, name, email)
  - [x] Establish data types for each property
  - [x] Document the structure for future reference
- [x] Implement unique ID generation for each entry (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create function to generate unique IDs
  - [x] Ensure IDs are truly unique
  - [x] Consider using UUID or timestamp-based approach
- [x] Create functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in memory (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement create function with proper parameter validation
  - [x] Implement read function to retrieve entries
  - [x] Implement update function to modify existing entries
  - [x] Implement delete function to remove entries
- [x] Ensure data integrity with validation functions (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create validation function for name field
  - [x] Create validation function for email field
  - [x] Implement validation before create/update operations
- [x] Implement data migration strategy for future changes (AC: 5)
  - [x] Design approach for handling data structure changes
  - [x] Create versioning system for data model
  - [x] Implement migration function for version upgrades

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the localStorage integration from Story 2.1 and the JavaScript framework from Story 1.3.

### File Locations
- Data model functions should be added to `js/main.js` or in a separate module file
- The data model should integrate with the existing localStorage functionality from Story 2.1

### Previous Story Insights
- The localStorage integration from Story 2.1 provides the persistence layer for the data model
- The JavaScript framework from Story 1.3 provides the structure for implementing the data model
- Consider using modern ES6+ JavaScript practices as mentioned in the technical assumptions

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing the data model as specified in the technical assumptions
- Consider implementing the data model as a class or module with methods for each operation
- Ensure proper validation functions are implemented for data integrity

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the data model should be performed by:
- Verifying that contact entry objects have the correct structure
- Checking that unique ID generation works correctly
- Testing create, read, update, and delete functions
- Ensuring data validation works as expected
- Testing the data migration strategy with different data versions

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List
1. Defined a consistent structure for contact entry objects using a dedicated Contact class
2. Established clear data types and validation rules for each property
3. Implemented unique ID generation using a timestamp and random string combination
4. Created comprehensive CRUD functions for managing contacts in memory
5. Implemented robust data integrity validation with detailed error reporting
6. Designed and implemented a data migration strategy with versioning support
7. Added version tracking to contact entries for future migration support
8. Created a DataMigrationManager class to handle migration of contacts between versions
9. Added proper error handling for all data operations
10. Ensured data model integrates seamlessly with existing localStorage functionality
11. All acceptance criteria have been met and thoroughly tested

### File List
- js/main.js

## QA Results

## Story Draft Validation Report

### Quick Summary
- **Story readiness**: READY
- **Clarity score**: 9/10
- **Major gaps identified**: None

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing the data model.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific approach should be used for unique ID generation (UUID, timestamp, etc.)?
  - Should the data model be implemented as a class or using the module pattern?
  - What specific validation rules should be applied to name and email fields?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the data structure needs to be modified to accommodate future requirements
  - If the validation requirements are more complex than described
  - If the data migration strategy needs to handle more complex scenarios

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the data model requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
