## Dev Notes
Since this is the first story in the project, there are no previous stories to reference for insights.

### File Locations
- Main HTML file should be created at the root of the project as `index.html`
- CSS file should be located at `css/style.css`
- JavaScript file should be located at `js/main.js`

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the HTML structure should be performed by:
- Validating the HTML structure using W3C HTML validator
- Checking that all required sections are present
- Verifying that CSS and JavaScript files are properly linked

## QA Results

## Story Draft Validation Report

### Quick Summary
- **Story readiness**: READY
- **Clarity score**: 8/10
- **Major gaps identified**: Minimal - mostly due to this being the first story in the project

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since this is the first story and architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet
- No previous stories to reference for context (expected for first story)

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on what needs to be created.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific meta tags are required for accessibility?
  - Are there any specific CSS classes or IDs that should be used for the form and list sections?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If accessibility requirements are more specific than what's described
  - If the file structure needs to be different than what's suggested

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. As the first story in the project, it appropriately sets up the basic structure without over-engineering. The acceptance criteria are clear and testable, and the tasks breakdown provides a logical implementation approach.
