# Story 1.3: JavaScript Framework Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the basic JavaScript structure,
**so that** I can implement the application logic efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create main JavaScript file with proper structure
2. Implement module pattern or classes for organization
3. Set up event listeners for DOMContentLoaded
4. Create basic functions for DOM manipulation
5. Implement a simple data structure for storing entries in memory

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create main JavaScript file with proper structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up basic file structure with necessary imports
  - [x] Add proper comments and documentation
  - [x] Ensure file is properly linked to HTML (from Story 1.1)
- [x] Implement module pattern or classes for organization (AC: 2)
  - [x] Choose between module pattern or ES6 classes
  - [x] Organize code into logical sections
  - [x] Ensure code is maintainable and readable
- [x] Set up event listeners for DOMContentLoaded (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add event listener for DOMContentLoaded
  - [x] Ensure DOM is ready before manipulating elements
  - [x] Initialize application components
- [x] Create basic functions for DOM manipulation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create function to add entries to the DOM
  - [x] Create function to update entries in the DOM
  - [x] Create function to remove entries from the DOM
- [x] Implement a simple data structure for storing entries in memory (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create array or object to store contact entries
  - [x] Implement basic CRUD operations on the data structure
  - [x] Ensure data structure is accessible throughout the application

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the HTML structure (Story 1.1) and CSS styling (Story 1.2).

### File Locations
- JavaScript file should be located at `js/main.js` (referenced in Story 1.1)
- The JavaScript should interact with the HTML elements created in Story 1.1:
  - Form elements for name and email input
  - Entry list display area
  - Controls for editing and deleting entries

### Previous Story Insights
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the elements that JavaScript will manipulate
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation
- Consider using modern ES6+ JavaScript practices as mentioned in the technical assumptions
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organization as specified in the technical assumptions

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the JavaScript functionality should be performed by:
- Verifying that the JavaScript file is properly loaded
- Checking that event listeners are correctly set up
- Testing basic DOM manipulation functions
- Ensuring the data structure works as expected

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List
1. Created a well-structured JavaScript file using ES6 classes for better organization
2. Implemented the ContactManager class to handle all CRUD operations and UI interactions
3. Set up proper event listeners for DOMContentLoaded and form interactions
4. Organized code into logical sections with clear method separation
5. Added comprehensive comments and documentation for maintainability
6. Implemented a data structure (array) for storing contact entries in memory
7. Created methods for all basic DOM manipulation functions (add, update, remove entries)
8. Ensured the JavaScript file is properly linked to the HTML from Story 1.1
9. Implemented proper error handling for localStorage operations
10. Added XSS protection through HTML escaping
11. All acceptance criteria have been met and thoroughly tested

### File List
- js/main.js

## QA Results

## Story Draft Validation Report

### Quick Summary

- **Clarity score**: 9/10
- **Major gaps identified**: None

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on the JavaScript structure needed.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - Should we use the module pattern or ES6 classes for organization?
  - What specific data structure should be used for storing entries?
  - Are there any specific DOM manipulation libraries that should be used?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the choice between module pattern and classes needs to be changed later
  - If the data structure needs to be modified to accommodate future requirements

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the JavaScript structure needed and how it relates to the previous stories.
