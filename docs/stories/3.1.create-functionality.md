- [x] Clear form after successful submission (AC: 6)
  - [x] Reset form fields to empty values
  - [x] Clear any validation error messages
  - [x] Return focus to first input field

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the foundation established in previous epics, particularly the data model (Story 2.2), localStorage integration (Story 2.1), and UI structure (Stories 1.1-1.3).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- UI elements should already exist from Story 1.1
- Styling should already be in place from Story 1.2

### Previous Story Insights
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the structure and functions for creating entries
- The localStorage integration from Story 2.1 provides the persistence layer
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the form elements
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation
- The JavaScript framework from Story 1.3 provides the event handling structure

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing the create functionality
- Implement proper validation as specified in the technical assumptions
- Ensure data is synchronized between memory and localStorage
- Consider user experience for form submission and feedback

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the create functionality should be performed by:
- Verifying that the form has proper input fields
- Checking that the submit button works correctly
- Testing form validation with various inputs
- Ensuring new entries are added to both memory and localStorage
- Verifying that the UI updates to display new entries
- Testing that the form clears after successful submission

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing the create functionality.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - What specific regex pattern should be used for email validation?
  - Should we implement real-time validation as users type?
  - How should validation errors be displayed to the user?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the validation requirements are more complex than described
  - If the UI needs to be modified to accommodate error messages
  - If the data synchronization between memory and localStorage encounters issues

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the create functionality requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
