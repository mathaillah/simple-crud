- [x] Remove entry from both memory and localStorage (AC: 3)
  - [x] Use data model functions to delete entry from memory (from Story 2.2)
  - [x] Save updated data to localStorage (from Story 2.1)
  - [x] Ensure data consistency between memory and storage
- [x] Update UI to reflect deletion immediately (AC: 4)
  - [x] Remove the specific entry from the entry list display
  - [x] Ensure proper reflow of remaining entries
  - [x] Maintain list organization

  - [x] Test behavior when deleting the last remaining entry
  - [x] Ensure proper handling of empty state after deletion
  - [x] Test behavior with rapid successive deletions

## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the update functionality (Story 3.3) and read functionality (Story 3.2).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- UI elements should be added to the existing entry list structure
- Styling should build upon the CSS from Story 1.2

### Previous Story Insights
- The update functionality from Story 3.3 provides the foundation for entry manipulation
- The read functionality from Story 3.2 provides the entry list display that will include delete buttons
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the structure and functions for deleting entries
- The localStorage integration from Story 2.1 provides the persistence layer
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the container for the entry list
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing the delete functionality
- Implement proper confirmation mechanism to prevent accidental deletions
- Ensure data is synchronized between memory and localStorage
- Consider user experience for deletion and feedback
- Implement proper error handling for delete operations

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the delete functionality should be performed by:
- Verifying that delete buttons are present for each entry
- Checking that confirmation dialog is shown before deletion
- Testing that entries are removed from both memory and localStorage
- Verifying that the UI updates to reflect deletions immediately
- Ensuring clear indication of successful deletion is provided
- Testing edge cases such as deleting the last entry

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing the delete functionality.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - Should we implement a custom confirmation dialog or use the browser's built-in confirmation?
  - How should we handle the confirmation dialog for accessibility?
  - What specific visual feedback should be provided for successful deletions?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If the confirmation mechanism requirements are more complex than described
  - If the UI needs to be modified to accommodate the delete buttons
  - If the data synchronization between memory and localStorage encounters issues

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the delete functionality requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
