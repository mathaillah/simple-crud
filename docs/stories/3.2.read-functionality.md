## Dev Notes
This story builds upon the create functionality (Story 3.1) and the data initialization (Story 2.3).

### File Locations
- Implementation should be integrated into `js/main.js` or appropriate module files
- UI elements should be added to the HTML structure from Story 1.1
- Styling should build upon the CSS from Story 1.2

### Previous Story Insights
- The create functionality from Story 3.1 provides the mechanism for adding entries that will be displayed
- The data initialization from Story 2.3 provides the foundation for displaying existing data
- The data model from Story 2.2 provides the structure for the entries to be displayed
- The HTML structure from Story 1.1 provides the container for the entry list
- The CSS styling from Story 1.2 provides the visual foundation

### Technical Considerations
- Follow the module pattern or classes for organizing the read functionality
- Consider performance optimization for large lists
- Ensure proper event handling for dynamic updates
- Implement efficient DOM manipulation techniques

### Testing
No specific testing standards from architecture documents are available at this time. Manual testing of the read functionality should be performed by:
- Verifying that all entries are displayed in the list
- Checking that name and email are shown correctly for each entry
- Testing that the display updates when entries are added, edited, or deleted
- Ensuring the list is readable and well-organized
- Testing the empty state when no entries exist

- **Major gaps identified**: None

### Validation Table

| Category                             | Status   | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS     | None |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS     | None |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS     | None |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS     | None |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PARTIAL  | Testing standards not yet established in architecture |

### Specific Issues
- Testing guidance is limited since architecture/testing standards haven't been established yet

### Developer Perspective
- **Could YOU implement this story as written?** Yes, the story provides clear guidance on implementing the read functionality.
- **What questions would you have?** 
  - Should we implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large lists?
  - How should we format long names or email addresses that might overflow?
  - What specific message should be displayed in the empty state?
- **What might cause delays or rework?** 
  - If performance optimization is needed for large lists
  - If the UI needs to be modified to accommodate different screen sizes
  - If the empty state design requirements are more specific than described

The story provides sufficient context for implementation. It clearly defines the read functionality requirements and how they build upon previous stories.
