**Session Date:** 2025-08-26
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** User

# Executive Summary

**Topic:** Simple Web Application for CRUD Operations on Name and Email Entries

**Session Goals:** Generate ideas for a simple web application that allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on name and email entries with a basic UI.

**Techniques Used:** Simplified Brainstorming

**Total Ideas Generated:** 12

## Key Themes Identified:
- Core functionality requirements
- Technology stack options
- User interface design considerations
- Data handling approaches

# Technique Sessions

## Simplified Brainstorming - 15 minutes

**Description:** Generated straightforward ideas for a CRUD web application without using formal brainstorming techniques.

### Ideas Generated:
1. Simple form with name and email input fields
2. Submit button to add new entries
3. Display list of all entries
4. Edit button next to each entry
5. Delete button next to each entry
6. Basic styling for a clean look
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
8. Node.js with Express for backend
9. MongoDB or SQLite for database
10. Clean, minimal design with responsive layout
11. Basic validation for email format
12. Local or server-side storage options

### Insights Discovered:
- The application's core functionality is straightforward but requires careful implementation of all CRUD operations
- Multiple technology stack options exist depending on complexity needs
- User experience is crucial even for simple applications
- Data validation and storage choices significantly impact the application's reliability

### Notable Connections:
- Frontend technology choices affect UI responsiveness and user experience
- Backend and database choices are interconnected and impact data handling
- Validation is important for both user experience and data integrity

# Reflection & Follow-up

## What Worked Well
- Focused on practical implementation ideas
- Considered multiple technology options
- Balanced immediate opportunities with future enhancements

## Areas for Further Exploration
- **Security Considerations**: How to properly handle and validate user data
  - Reason: Important for any application handling user information

- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques for handling large datasets
  - Reason: May become important as the application scales

## Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Six Thinking Hats**: To evaluate technical decisions from different perspectives
  - Reason: Would help in choosing between different technology options

- **SCAMPER Method**: To enhance the basic CRUD functionality
  - Reason: Could generate ideas for additional features

## Questions That Emerged
- What validation rules should we implement for name and email fields?
- How should we handle errors in CRUD operations?
- Should we implement search or filtering capabilities?

## Next Session Planning
